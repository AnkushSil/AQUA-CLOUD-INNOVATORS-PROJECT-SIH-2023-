Ideation for Innovative Technology to Harvest Water from Humid Air using Nanotechnology by mimicking the Stenocara Structure of Desert Namib beetles.
Collaborated with environmental scientists to analyse the ecological impact of the water-harvesting technology; findings supported potential implementation in island regions facing critical freshwater shortages.
Studied the natural adaptations of fog-collecting organisms, such as the Namib Desert beetle in harvesting water harvesting from fog using biomimetics.
Mimicked the unique structures of the beetle using 3D printing technology and concluded that optimization of results can be achieved by the application of nanotechnology.
Explored the product installation cost and the efficiency of water collection through the application of nanotechnology in island regions.
Presented the idea to Professional Mentors and Stakeholders; gained valuable feedback at SIH 2023.
